# 《Unsupervised learning of digit recognition using spike-timing-dependent plasticity》 realization on Brian2  

Requirements : *brian2=2.5.0.3, brian2tools=0.3, pickle=3.3.2*  

Firstly, move MNIST dataset to the main derectory  
Then, run ```python Brian2_trainning.py``` until the simulation finished  
Finally, run ```python Brian2_evaluation.py``` and you will get the accuracy
